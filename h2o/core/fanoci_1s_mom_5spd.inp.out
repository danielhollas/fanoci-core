************************************* WARNING *************************************
 1 out of 75 eigenvalues of the overlap matrix are smaller than xtol = 1.0e-05
 and will be flushed to zero. In many cases this is caused by bad geometry of the
 molecule, Cartesian basis sets, or the use of diffuse basis functions. 
 Try using a spherical basis representation 'sphericalbasis yes'. If the SCF procedure does not
 converge, increase the threshold by setting 'xtol' to 1.0e-04 or 1.0e-03 and/or
 decrease the coulomb and exchange integral screening thresholds 'threall' 
 up to 1.0e-21 or 1.0e-22. In addition, you can try to loosen the the WF 
 convergence threshold, perform several geometry optimization steps, and run the 
 calculations again with the new geometry. You can also try to switch to double
 precision instead of mixed (default) or single precision.

Reached max number of SCF iterations (maxit = 100)
SCF did not converge
Try to decrease the coulomb and exchange integral screening thresholds by setting
'threall' to 1.0e-21 or even 1.0e-22. If it does not help, try pure double precision
instead of mixed (default) or single precision
Also try 'scf diis+a' convergence algorithm if you're using the default.
