$prop
        prop_type = "el"  ! "el" for ionization (electron propagator), "pol" for excitation (polarization propagator)
$end

$init
        hs_in = "1" ! number of the HF orbital associated with the decaying state, always as a string, maybe later I find a better way to do it, in the case of excitation you can have a list of orbitals separated by a space "1 2 3"
        ps_in = "0" ! this section should be zero if you do ionization, an orbital number or list of orbitals for excitation "1 2 3"
$end

$final
        h_f_min = 2 ! this is the former ov_min section, where you select the orbitals which you use to construct the final 2h1p states
        h_f_max = 5 ! former ov_max section
        p_f_min = 6 ! former k_min section
        p_f_max = 0 ! former k_max section - use 0 if you want to include all virtual orbitals in the calculation
$end

$control
        n_occ = 5    ! number of occupied orbitals
        prnt = 0      ! a flag for printing the eigenvalues and eigenvectors for each virtual orbital
        gam = "total" ! for ionization you have "total", "singlet", "triplet"
        moint = 0     ! whether to reduce the moint file such that it contains only OOOO, OOOV, OOVV, OVOV integrals; if == 1, only the moint calculation will be done and the selected integrals will be written in moint_red.txt file
        eig_thresh = 0.1 ! a threshold value for printing the eigenvectors
